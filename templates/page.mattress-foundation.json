Unlike simply placing a mattress on the floor, a good foundation provides:</p><ul><li><strong>Enhanced Support:</strong> Distributes weight evenly and prevents sagging.</li><li><strong>Improved Airflow:</strong> Helps with temperature regulation and moisture control.</li><li><strong>Aesthetic Appeal:</strong> Complements your bedroom decor and can add a touch of style.</li></ul><p><br/></p><h2>Types of Mattress Foundations</h2><h3>1. Box Springs</h3><p>Box springs are traditional foundations featuring a wooden frame covered with fabric and fitted with springs. They are designed to absorb shock, provide additional support, and add height to your bed.</p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>Increases mattress longevity</li><li>Offers extra cushioning</li><li>Creates a uniform sleeping surface</li></ul><p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p><ul><li>May not be compatible with all modern mattresses (like some memory foam models)</li><li>Can be heavy and difficult to move</li></ul><p>Mattressville offers 3 types of foundations: posture box, semi-flex, coil spring.</p><h4><strong>Posture Box</strong></h4><p>A slatted wooden frame with a flat platform top, it’s usually covered in the same fabric as the mattress for a more cohesive look. A posture box is not a ‘box spring’, as it has no springs, and is therefore less effective for supporting the weight of the mattress.</p><h4><strong>Semi Flex</strong></h4><p>Similar to the construction of the posture box, but with the addition of a rigid metal grid network affixed above the slats, this type of foundation is also very firm and absorbs little weight from the mattress.</p><h4><strong>Coil Spring</strong></h4><p>This is the standard ‘box spring’, and it’s usually found matched to mid-priced bedding sets. The coil spring foundation uses a spring system similar to the basic mattress innerspring; however, due to the greater gauge of the coils and the larger size of the foundation, the foundation is much firmer than an innerspring mattress. Nonetheless, the coil spring foundation has the softest feel of any foundation available.</p><p>Learn more about the specifics of box springs on our related accessory guides (see <a href=\"https://mattressville.ca/blogs/accessory-guide/box-spring-guide\">Box Spring Basics</a> for further reading—but note this page provides a broader context).</p><p></p><h3>2. Adjustable Bed Bases</h3><p>Adjustable beds allow you to change the angle of your head and legs, offering customizable comfort for reading, watching TV, or alleviating back pain.</p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>Enhanced comfort with customizable positions</li><li>Can help relieve snoring and acid reflux</li><li>Often includes massage or USB features</li></ul><p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p><ul><li>Higher upfront cost</li><li>Requires compatible mattresses (check with your mattress brand for recommendations)</li></ul><p>For a wide range of options and to find the perfect fit for your sleep needs, browse our <a href=\"https://mattressville.ca/collections/adjustable-beds\">adjustable beds collection.</a><br/></p><h3>3.
