A comfortable bed is key to getting a good night's sleep. Our Comfort Guarantee is offered to underline our commitment to providing a great night's sleep. The Comfort Guarantee allows for the replacement of a mattress if you find your original purchase to be of the wrong comfort level. Although it rarely happens that our customers are unsatisfied with their new mattress purchase, we are so confident in our range of quality mattresses that we're willing to give you a couple of months to try out your selection. If you feel at any point that you're not getting the best night's sleep with your new mattress, you can contact us to arrange an exchange for a new mattress.<\/p>",
